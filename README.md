# go-simple

Learning Go.  To be in the know.  As Picard said "Make it so."

Ok, that was corny with a capital K.

This is a place for simple GoLang programs done while learning the language.  Mostly it will be simple one-file programs to implement Katas or test out simple ideas.  Only putting here so I can access from any machine while I'm remote.
